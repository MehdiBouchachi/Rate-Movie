# usePopcorn App
The usePopcorn project is a simple yet effective learning tool designed to help developers explore the power of custom hooks and reusable components in React. It serves as a great introduction to building scalable and maintainable React applications by abstracting logic and creating modular UI components.

# Description
The usePopcorn app simulates a movie library where users can:

Browse a list of movies.

Add movies to a favorites list (your "popcorn" list).

Remove movies from the popcorn list.

Mark movies as watched or unwatched.

This project demonstrates how to efficiently handle shared logic using custom hooks and how to build reusable UI components to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication.

# Features
Custom Hook (usePopcorn):
Abstracts the state management logic for managing the popcorn list, making the application more modular and reusable.

Reusable Components:
Components such as buttons, movie cards, and lists are designed to be generic and adaptable to different parts of the app.

Dynamic State Management:
Efficiently handles the addition, removal, and toggling of movie states using React's useState and useReducer.

Interactive UI:
Provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with the movie list.

# Why This Project?

Custom Hooks:
Introduces the concept of creating and using custom hooks to encapsulate and share logic across components.

Reusability:
Demonstrates best practices for building reusable components to simplify application scaling and maintenance.

Beginner to Intermediate Learning:
A great way for developers transitioning from basic React concepts to more advanced topics.

# Technologies Used

React: For building the component-based user interface.
Custom Hooks: To manage shared logic in a clean and reusable way.

CSS: For styling and enhancing the user experience.

# Key Takeaways
Learn how to abstract repetitive logic into custom hooks.

Understand how to design and use reusable React components.

Get comfortable with state management using React hooks like useState and useReducer.

Gain experience in organizing code for better readability and scalability.

Explore the importance of separation of concerns for cleaner React applications.

The usePopcorn project is perfect for developers looking to advance their React skills and master the concepts of reusability and logic abstraction.
